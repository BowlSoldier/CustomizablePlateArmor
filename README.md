Adds new variants of all non-steel plate armors which have the same defensive protections as full steel plate.



This is to open up more cosmetic options which are equally as viable as plate, allowing for more cosmetic variety on multiplayer servers.



To create these, the recipe uses Steel armor piece as the base. You then use a hammer and a plate of the relevant material to change the armor's style to that of Copper, Gold, etc, but with the Steel metal's colouration and protection.



This uses the Combat Overhaul versions of the plate armor sets, and will not work for vanilla.
